# data_collection
Background
Welcome to your new project on web scraping and data analysis focused on Mars exploration. In this project, you will apply your skills in identifying HTML elements, using automated browsing, and parsing HTML to extract valuable data from websites related to Mars.

What You're Creating
This project consists of two main deliverables, each housed in a separate Jupyter Notebook:

Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News Articles
You will scrape news articles related to Mars and extract their titles and preview texts using Beautiful Soup.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
You will scrape Mars weather data from a table on a specified webpage and perform analysis using Pandas, answering key questions about Martian weather patterns.

Instructions
Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Open part_1_mars_news.ipynb and follow these steps:
- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site and inspect the HTML elements.
- Create a Beautiful Soup object to extract titles and preview texts of the news articles.
- Store the scraped data in Python dictionaries and then in a list.
- Optionally, export the data to a JSON file for sharing.

Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
Open part_2_mars_weather.ipynb and complete the following tasks:
- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site and identify the table structure.
- Use Beautiful Soup to scrape the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Clean and prepare the data, ensuring appropriate data types.
- Perform data analysis using Pandas to answer specific questions about Martian weather:
  - Number of months on Mars
  - Martian days (sols) of data available
  - Coldest and warmest months based on minimum daily temperatures
  - Months with lowest and highest atmospheric pressure
  - Estimate of terrestrial days in a Martian year based on temperature data
- Visualize insights using bar charts.
- Export the final DataFrame to a CSV file.
  
Conclusion
By completing this project, you will strengthen your skills in web scraping, data manipulation, and visualization, specifically in the context of Mars exploration data. Feel free to explore additional analyses or visualizations beyond the outlined tasks to deepen your understanding.
